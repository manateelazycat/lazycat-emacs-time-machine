;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Init helm
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put init-helm.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'init-helm)
;;
;; In Mac OS, you perhaps need execute below command to build locate db:
;;
;; sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist
;;

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET init-helm RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2018/11-01
;;      * Fix `helm-ls-git' not work when first run `helm-dwim'.
;;
;; 2018/10-29
;;      * Use `helm-ls-git' instead `helm-projectile', helm so fast now!!!
;;
;; 2018/09/03
;;      * Make filename has enough width to display full name.
;;
;; 2018/07/26
;;      * Make `helm-source-buffers-list' first, otherwise can't switch to with exist buffer list.
;;
;; 2018/07/12
;;      * Add `helm-source-locate' in `helm-source-list' for search file in file system.
;;
;; 2018/06/29
;;      * Remove `helm-autoload-commands', one-key is enough.
;;
;; 2018/06/28
;;      * Update some key of helm-map.
;;
;; 2018/06/14
;;      * Upgrade configuration to match git version of helm.
;;      * Just add helm-source-projectile-* in list when current place in project, avoid `helm-source-projectile-files-list' block `helm-dwim'.
;;
;; 2013/12/30
;;      * First released.
