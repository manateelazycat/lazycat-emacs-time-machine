# What is multi-term.el ?

MultiTerm is a mode based on term.el, for managing multiple terminal buffers in Emacs.

Details please look [EmacsWiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MultiTerm)

I mainly use [Aweshell](https://github.com/manateelazycat/aweshell) now,
but I still maintain multi-term.el, feel free send PR to me, thank you!
