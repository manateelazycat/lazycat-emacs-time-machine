;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Tray widget that stick right-edge of minibuffer
;;
;; Because i hide mode-line in Deepin-Emacs.
;; And i still need see informations, such as time, row/column, editable, sometimes.
;;
;; Since Emacs don't allowed split minibuffer window,
;; i use epc and pyqt implement tray widget that stick right-edge of minibuffer window,
;; for display information i want see.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; NOTE: just minibuffer-tray.el can't work, you need install below depends first:
;;       * PyQt5:       http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
;;       * Python-Xlib: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-xlib
;;       * python-dbus
;;
;; Detail description please look: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MiniBufferTray
;;
;; Then put minibuffer-tray.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'minibuffer-tray)
;; (minibuffer-tray-mode 1)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;; `minibuffer-tray-hide-mode-line' default is t to hide mode-line.
;; `minibuffer-tray-height' the height of minibuffer-tray.
;; `minibuffer-tray-name' the name of minibuffer-tray buffer.
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET minibuffer-tray RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2017/10/20
;;      * Add `minibuffer-tray-stop-kill-buffer' hook to avoid minibuffer tray's buffer kill by command `kill-buffer'.
;;
;; 2014/10/11
;;      * Add customize options.
;;
;; 2014/10/10
;;      * Don't query user minibuffer-tray process when emacs exit.
;;      * Add remove mode-line code in header comment.
;;
;; 2014/10/08
;;      * Use DBus instead Python-EPC as communication between Emacs and PyQt process.
;;      Elisp and python code much simple after switch to DBus implementation.
;;
;; 2014/01/26
;;      * First released.
